So the way that instruction-tuned LLMs are typically trained is you start off with a base LLM that's been trained on a huge amount of text data, further fine-tune it with inputs and outputs that are instructions and good attempts to follow those instructions, and then often further refine using a technique called RLHF, reinforcement learning from human feedback, to make the system better able to be helpful and follow instructions. \n",

       "I purchased this adorable panda plush toy as a birthday gift for my daughter, who has a penchant for sneaking into my room and taking mine. It's worth noting that pandas are not just for children; even adults can't resist their charm. \n",
       "\n",
       "From the moment my daughter unwrapped this gift, she has been inseparable from it. The plush toy's irresistibly soft and cuddly texture makes it the perfect companion for her daily adventures. However, I did notice a minor flaw in its design - one of the ears is slightly lower than the other, which seems unintentional. \n",
       "\n",
       "While the quality of the toy is undeniably exceptional, I must admit that I expected it to be slightly larger considering its price. It would be wise to explore other options that offer a larger size for the same price point. \n",
       "\n",
       "On a positive note, the delivery of the panda plush toy exceeded my expectations. It arrived a day earlier than anticipated, allowing me to indulge in some playtime with it before presenting it to my daughter. \n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, despite its minor imperfections, this panda plush toy is a delightful gift that brings joy to both children and adults alike. Its softness, cuteness, and early arrival make it a compelling choice for any panda enthusiast."
